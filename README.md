Examining whether interpretative uncertainty in media coverage correlates with stock market volatility.

**Overview**

This repository contains the code, datasets, and analysis for the study of how media-driven interpretative uncertainty affects financial market volatility. The study introduces the Model Disagreement Index (MDI) to quantify divergent interpretations of news across social media and traditional media, and investigates its relationship with stock market fluctuations during notable events such as the SVB collapse and Netflix subscriber loss.

**Methodology**
- Social media data collected via Twitter/X API through Apify
- News articles retrieved from Google News
- Financial market data retrieved from Yahoo Finance
- Sentiment analysis performed using pre-trained NLP models (NLPTown and CardiffNLP)
- Construction of Media Disagreement Index (MDI) to measure interpretative uncertainty
- Alignment of media and financial data to explore temporal correlations
