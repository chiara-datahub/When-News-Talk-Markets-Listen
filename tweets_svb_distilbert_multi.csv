The government should stay out of this and let the market correct. If the government responds by expanding credit, it will make matters worse. F.A. Hayek said:
 
“To combat a depression by a forced credit expansion, is akin to the attempt to fight an evil by its own causes; because we suffer from a misdirection of production, we want even more misdirection — an approach that necessarily leads to an even more serious crisis once the credit expansion comes to an end.”

Economic depressions are necessary to expose all of the malinvestment created by bad central banking policy. Ludwig von Mises said:

It only brings to light the malinvestments and other mistakes that were made under the hallucination of the illusory prosperity created by the easy money.”",https://twitter.com/MLiamMcCollum/status/1634240870668193793,3,1,13,0,False,2023-03-10,-1.0

1634633136469422080,"One of the largest banks in the U.S. has collapsed. This is the biggest banking collapse since 2008.

Silicon Valley Bank, one of Silicon Valley's most popular banks, closed unexpectedly in the U.S. Startups and crypto companies had money in it and it was lending to them. 

This is the biggest bank collapse since 2008. Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th bank in the United States. Customers withdrew $42 billion from Silicon Valley Bank overnight and there were lines outside the bank's branches.

Silicon Valley Bank's problems led to a stock crash at Silvergate Bank and First Republic Bank, which also lent to startups. Trading of their shares also came to a halt.

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank caused problems for the second and third most popular cryptocurrency steblecoins - USDC and DAI. USDC operator Circle held up to $10 billion in assets at Silicon Valley Bank. USDC and DAI have lost their link to the dollar (usually traded 1 to 1) and were losing more than 10% to the U.S. dollar today. Which brings the promise of a new wave of collapses and losses.

SVB's British arm had sought 1.8 Billion Pounds of Liquidity from BoE via its discount window facility, which offers emergency funding to banks “IF"" they have adequate collateral. In return...got Insolvency Proceedings initiated.

Under Insolvency Proceedings for banks in UK, some depositors are eligible for up to 85000 pounds of compensation for lost deposits & 170000 Pounds for Joint Accounts.
Rest in hands of Jesus Christ.

NOTE: In Bharat...Modi Govt has increased Insurance of Deposits to ₹5 Lakhs for which he was Criticised by ECONOMISTS & Liberals.

Anyways...

The rout in SVB's stock, which began on Thursday, has spilled over into other U.S. & European banks. U.S. banks have lost over $100 Billion in stock market value & European banks have shed another $50 billion in value in past two days.

Mind you....These Banks are not #Adani to bounce back in 1 month.

1635241897324150784,"Literally 5 days after being named among the Top banks in the United States by Forbes Magazine, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has collapsed, with regulators taking control of the bank due to its inability to meet withdrawal demands from depositors.

Right after SVB, Signature Bank also became next casualty of banking turmoil as Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took control of Signature, which had $110.36 billion in assets and $88.59 in deposits at the end of last year, according to New York state's Department of Financial Services.

The failure of two major US banks over the weekend made stock markets around the world nervous on Monday, as concerns grow over systemic risks at lenders in the world’s most powerful economy.

HSBC bought the UK arm of stricken Silicon Valley Bank for a symbolic one pound on Monday, rescuing a key lender for technology start-ups in Britain and helping curb the fallout from the biggest bank collapse since Washington Mutual in the 2008 financial crisis.

The move comes after US authorities moved to shore up deposits and stem any wider contagion from the sudden collapse of its parent Silicon Valley Bank.

The Federal Reserve Board has now announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. The regulators have said that depositors of SVB will have access to their uninsured deposits on Monday (US time) and no losses would be paid for by taxes.

The bank's failure to meet withdrawal demands caused a run on the bank, which led to the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) taking over the bank's operations after it went insolvent.

President Joe Biden said that he ordered the Treasury Department and his economic advisers to address the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, adding that those responsible will be held accountable.

1635368543217676303,"The US federal reserve has come up with a way to deal with a banking crisis where Silicon Valley Bank clients will get their deposits back. However, this solution may cause more problems for regular people in the long term.

Before March 26, 2020, the US financial system was based on fractional reserve banking, where banks only kept a portion of client deposits on hand and used the rest to make a profit. The federal reserve lent money to banks and the government, which allowed for growth in the system through lending.

On March 15, 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced a change to reserve requirements. On March 26, 2020, the US banking system became NO RESERVE banking, which meant banks could do whatever they wanted with all client deposits. Silicon Valley Bank was one of these banks and invested in long-term assets with short-term deposits, leading to its collapse in 36 hours when too many withdrawals were requested.

To prevent bank runs, the federal reserve created the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which allows banks to take loans with bank assets as collateral to meet the needs of depositors.  This solution sounds great, but it means the wealth gap may become wider as banks can buy even more assets, pay bigger bonuses, and increase the price of goods for everyone.

The average person may feel the pain of inflation and unaffordable assets, reducing their chances of achieving financial freedom. 

The solution: Bitcoin.

TLDR; 
Banks are no more to be trusted with your funds!

 The recent events with Silvergate Capital and Silicon Valley Bank failing, and Credit Suisse facing troubles, indicate that the traditional banking system is struggling. The US Government stepping in to bail out these banks shows that the authorities are concerned about the stability of the financial system.

At the same time, the rally in Bitcoin indicates that investors are seeking alternative assets that are not tied to the traditional financial system. Bitcoin's decentralized and independent nature makes it an attractive option for those who are concerned about the stability of the traditional financial system.

Overall, the market is telling us that there is a growing need for alternative financial systems that can provide stability and security in times of crisis.

Why was this banking crisis such a surprise? Is it really your job to diligence your employer's bank's financials? Aren't you paying for regulators to do that?

Unfortunately, the regulators were captured. As these posts from Sept 2022[1] and Nov 2022[2] show,  regulators like FDIC and the Fed *knew* that SVB — and hundreds of other banks — had less assets than their liabilities.

In other words, the banks didn't have your money. They intentionally used accounting tricks[3] to hide their insolvency. And the regulators let them hide[4] things in footnotes.

What the regulators didn't do was notify you, the depositors, that all your money was gone. You paid for all the regulation, and got none of the consumer protection.

They still haven't been warned. Though now of course they're printing money to silently replace what they lost.

As for getting ""back"" 100 cents on the dollar from your business checking account for a crisis that even Yellen admits[3] was caused by the Fed's rate hikes — a solvency crisis that the regulators clearly knew about in advance[4] and let happen anyway via the messy mechanism of a bank run without *somehow* notifying anyone — seems reasonable.

Though we really should look into why regulators  didn't warn depositors of the banking-sector wide insolvencies, and allowed them to be buried in footnotes.[5]
